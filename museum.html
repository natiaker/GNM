                        <p>The origins of the Museum of Georgia stem from the foundation of the Russian Royal Geographic Society's Museum of the Caucasian Department on May 10, 1852. In 1865, the Museum of the Caucasus was established as part of the aforementioned department, on the initiative of Gustav Rade. The first exhibition was held in 1867. In 1881, the Museum of the Caucasus took an active part in the fifth international congress of archeologists, held in Tbilisi. In 1919, the museum was renamed the Georgian Museum. </p>
                        <p>In February, 1921, the Georgian Menshevik government made a decision to relocate state treasures from Georgian museums and churches out of Tbilisi, due to Bolshevik aggression towards Georgia. The treasure was first moved to Kutaisi and then to Batumi, but was eventually packed in 248 boxes and tranported to France. In spite of great obstacles, the famous Georgian public figure, Ekvtime Takaishvili, preserved and safely returned these treasures to Georgia at the close of the Second World War. </p>
                        <p>After the Soviet occupation, a new stage of museum development began. In this period, the scale of scientific research increased markedly, and unique expeditions were held under the auspices of the state-supported museum. Since 1947, the museum has been known as the Simon Janashia museum. Due to tense political situations occurring before and after Georgia's independence from Soviet rule, the museum had to operate extremely carefully in order to protect its collections.</p>
                        <p>In 2004, the museum was incorporated into the Georgian National Museum complex. Today, the museum has carried out significant reforms in the pursuit of setting modern standards for the preservation and exhibition of Georgian heritage.</p>
                        <p>The museum currently houses a unique collection of natural and human history, with animal remains dating back 40 million years, and rich archaeological and ethnographic collections from the Paleolithic, Neolithic, Bronze, Iron and Middle Ages.</p>
                        <p>The museum has been under renovation for several years, and in June 2011, one part of the museum's exhibition halls reopened to the public. Currently, you can enjoy the permanent exhibition "The Archaeological Treasury" and temporary exhibitions held periodically at the museum.</p>
                        <p>Alongside the permanent and temporary exhibition area, museum has high standard auditorium (renovated in February 2007 equipped with modern technologies and a seating capacity of 110) - this multifunctional public space is the analogue of the BP Conference Hall at the British Museum. It offers the possibilities of having lectures, presentations, meetings, film shows, concerts, and various other educational and cultural activities.</p>
                        <p>Alongside the auditorium museum has a library as well as public spaces - cafe, museum shop and courtyard.</p>

                        <p>The Georgian National Gallery was established in 1920. Dimitri Shevardnadze, a well-known Georgian painter, contributed significantly to the development of the gallery. Since its foundation, the gallery has served the development of Georgian fine arts.</p>
                        <p>The gallery itself was built based on a resolution from Russian tsar in 1888. The building was originally allocated as a Russian military and historic museum, known as the Temple of Glory, intended to showcase the power of the Russian Empire in its colonies. Artifacts from the Temple of Glory were evacuated during the First World War, putting an end to the museum's first phase.</p>
                        <p>The first exhibition of the National Gallery, as it was re-established under independent Georgian Menshevik rule, dates back to October 1920. The exhibition policy of the gallery was broad in scope, presenting Georgian and foreign works from all time periods and artistic movements to the public.</p>
                        <p>The first exhibition was the fruit of Dimitri Shevardnadze's hard work collecting as many fine art works as were available in Georgia at the time. The exhibition included 18th and 19th century Georgian portraits (from the so-called "Georgian School"), Russian, Western European, Iranian and contemporary Georgian paintings.</p>
                        <p>Thereafter, the Gallery kept a reserve collection profound in its breadth and quality. As a result, the National Gallery could function as a museum of fine arts while simultaneously supporting its primary mission of promoting contemporary fine arts.</p>
                        <p>However, the building had only limited space and the majority of works could not be exhibited, leaving painters without valuable space to present their works to the public. To remedy this, the Gallery developed a reorganization plan. Director Dimitri Shevardnadze's attention shifted to the Metekhi Castle Fortress, a historic venue considered it most appropriate to house the National Gallery.</p>
                        <p>In 1933, the municipal prison was moved from Metekhi to Ortachala, and Metekhi's historic building was delivered to the National Art Gallery's board of directors. The whole treasury of the National Gallery was placed at Metekhi in 1934, at which point the National Gallery re-opened to the public. Under Soviet rule, the National Gallery took the state's cultural policies and turned them in the direction of the fine arts.</p>
                        <p>In March 1988, the museum-exhibition union "National Gallery of Artwork" was established by the board management of Artists' House, which featured exhibition halls for contemporary Georgian art. The union's central institution was the Modern Art Museum. The exposition was placed at the National Gallery, which required enlargement and reconstruction in order to house it. The first floor, which was previously dedicated to administrative space and collections storage, was converted into a more accessible exhibition gallery.</p>
                        <p>An exposition of Modern Georgian took place on September 18th, 1989. But as a result of political instability in the 1990s, the Modern Art Museum had to cease operations.  </p>
                        <p>In 2007, the National Gallery joined the Georgian National Museum complex. The main gallery building was once again renovated.  New, modern exhibition space was added to the gallery, encompassing eight exhibition halls, a restoration laboratory, temporary exhibit reserves, training space, and a gift shop, all implemented by the Portuguese Architectural company "Ainda Arquitectura".

                        <p>The Tbilisi History Museum was founded in 1910 as the City Municipal Museum. More recently, it was given the name of the famous Georgian poet Ioseb Grishashvili. Since 1984, the Tbilisi History Museum has been located in a restored caravanserai, representing the city's historic role as a Silk Road trading outpost.</p>
                        <p>The museum houses over fifty thousand artifacts. They reflect Tbilisi's history from the end of the 4 millennium BCE to the present day. The museum presents archeological, ethnological and archival materials as well as the pieces of national and applied arts, and a rich photo-collection. A number of unique works of artistic and graphic arts are also preserved in this museum.</p>
                        <p>Together with older works, the museum also exhibits pieces of contemporary art. Since 1986, many exhibitions of Georgian and foreign artists have been displayed at the museum.</p>

                        <p>After several years of work by the Museum team, another new museum has been added to the institution of the Georgian National Museum. In celebration of the International Museum Day, we present Bolnisi Museum for the first time. <br>

                        Bolnisi Museum is a model of the 21st century regional museum and the new ecosystem in general â€“ where different segments as science, culture, education, and tourism coexist in one space. <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        The museum building has a permanent exhibition area and also a temporary exhibition hall. Modern infrastructure has enabled us to provide high standard storage facilities, scientific laboratory, auditorium, multimedia library, as well as public spaces - cafes, museum shop, and open verandas.<br><br>
                        
                        The permanent exhibition displays significant archaeological materials and artworks mainly from the collections of the Georgian National Museum and also from the local museum. <br><br>
                        
                        New Bolnisi Museum presents the history of the bio-cultural diversity of the region and its connection with the global context with the synthesis of classic museum methodology and modern technologies.<br><br>
                        
                        The permanent exhibition, shows the nature of the region, the history of the first hominins, emergence of agriculture, ancient metallurgy and Bronze Age cultures, early-Christian architecture, examples of the old Georgian inscriptions and stone, clay objects of medieval era.<br><br>
                        
                        The last hall of the exhibition is dedicated to the history of the German population who emigrated from South Germany to Georgia 200 years ago and also to Kvemo Kartli in general, as a multicultural region where Armenians, Azerbaijanis, Ossetians, Greeks, Russians, Germans, and others lived with Georgians. <br><br>
                        
                        The museum creates a multifunctional-educational platform focused on visitors of all ages and interests. It is an art center, a creative space, a place of fun, and learning for children.
                        <br><br>
                        On the second floor of the museum is the Goethe-Institut Multimedia Library, which offers customers a well-equipped comfortable work environment, space for creative meetings, the latest German language textbooks, a library of science, fiction and subject-specific books, a collection of films and audio materials. <br><br>

                        <p>Vani Archeological Museum is one of the first archeological museums set up on a settlement in the Caucasus region, established in 1985 on September 29, and named after its founder â€“ Otar Lordkipanidze. The Museum is situated on a hill close to the town of Vani in western Georgia, on the left bank of the River Rioni. The building is according to the project of architect Giorgi Lezhava. <br><br>
                        The Vani settlement which covers almost the whole first millennium BC is an archaeological monument of world importance. From 8th-7th centuries BC till 1st century BC Vani was the religious center of Kolkheti â€“ the country of the Golden Fleece. <br><br>
                        There are numerous artifacts discovered in the Vani settlement and its environs preserved in the museum collections. These items are dated back to 8th-1st centuries BC. Materials discovered in the Vani settlement have crucial importance for studying antiquity. The museum includes the archaeological site of Vani, the expedition base, and the museum itself.<br><br>
                        Part of the Vani archeological materials are displayed in Tbilisi at GNN Simon Janashia Museum of Georgia. <br><br>
                        Since 2006 the Vani Museum is part of the Georgian National Museum institution. </p>

                        <p>The Samtskhe-Javakheti Museum is located in the southern part of Georgia. It was established as an archive-museum in 1923.  In 1937, it was converted into a museum of local history, and its preexisting collection was joined by materials representing regional culture and history. The rich collection of the museum reflects the region's unique qualities on the Georgian border. <br> <br>
                        The majority of the region's material heritage is represented in the museum: ancient manuscripts, epigraphic and ethnographic material, and photo documents. <br> <br>
                        Today, more than 25 thousand artifacts (among them manuscripts and early printed materials) are preserved in the museum collections. Works of Georgian lapidary (jewel-working) technique and woven carpets have an important place at the museum.</p>
